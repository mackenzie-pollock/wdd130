    <p>I'm from Yuma, AZ, and am in my second semester of college. 
        I'm the second oldest of 7 (aka the favorite child). </p>
    </p>I'm originally from Cali, where I graduated a year early from high school in Needles, CA right before my family moved to Yuma a little over 6 months ago.</p>
    <p>My favorite thing in the whole world is being in the water. 
        I love being on any sort of board pulled behind a boat!
    I love anything fun and active. </p>
    </p>I'm so excited about this class, 
    and can't wait to learn cool nerdy smart things!</p>
